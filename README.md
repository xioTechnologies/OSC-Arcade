OSC-Arcade
==========

This project includes designs for two arcade controllers: *x-OSC joystick* and *x-OSC arcade*.  Each controller is a wooden box mounting arcade buttons and a joysticks from [sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) and use an [x-OSC](http://www.x-io.co.uk/x-osc/) to stream control signals via WiFi.  The *x-OSC joystick* uses only the [joystick with button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9136).  The *x-OSC arcade* uses a [short joytick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9182), [green button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9179), [pink button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9177), [yellow button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9180), [red button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9336), [dark green button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9341) and [black button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9339).

The parts making up each controller are designed to be laser-cut from 6 mm thick plywood and slot fit together with with glue.  The x-OSC is held in place with [sugru](https://sugru.com/).  The parts are designed in Adobe Illustrator where red lines should be a cut and blue or black areas engraved.  The source files include wiring diagrams and photos of the assembled controllers.
